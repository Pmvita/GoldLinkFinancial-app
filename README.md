## 🎨 Design System

Following a recent comprehensive UI overhaul, GoldLink Bank's design language is rooted in exclusivity. The aesthetic relies heavily on:
- **Deep Carbon (`#111111` to `#1A1A1A`):** For profound depth, reduced eye strain, and a modern, executive feel.
- **Metallic Gold (`#D4AF37`, `#AA7C11`):** As the primary accent, conveying wealth, prestige, and trust.
- **Dynamic Layouts:** Liquid responsiveness guaranteeing that high-density financial data remains legible, beautifully aligned, and fully functional on any screen size.
